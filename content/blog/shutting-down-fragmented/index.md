title: I am Shutting Down Fragmented

It has been about 1.5 years since I started the Fragmented project and I have decided to shut it down today. I think the problems that I attempted to solve with Fragmented are real. On Reddit and similar platforms, there are issues with moderation and curation that Ethereum could potentially solve. However, despite having some initial traction, I have struggled to attract users after the crypto market crash and think that the timing for a project like this is a little too early. In addition, I do not have the financial resources to work on this project full time and am not interested in trying to raise capital for it.

If you have been following this project and were one of the few people to try out the beta thank you for your support, and I am sorry I was not able to fulfill the vision of a decentralized social network. There are many other projects with similar goals, so please seek those out and engage with those communities if you are still interested in this kind of platform.
