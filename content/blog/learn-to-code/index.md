If you want to learn how to code, here is my advice:

1. Start with JavaScript as your language. With JavaScipt you can build web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, and more. There are lots of beginner-friendly courses. It is also one of the most popular languages with lots of jobs.
2. Pick a project
3. Try to build it
4. Seek help from Google and StackOverflow when you are stuck
5. Share your project with potential users
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for the rest of your life (there are always new things to learn)

If you are interested in building web, mobile, or desktop apps I recommend going through this list of free courses:

- [Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
- [Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)
- [Learn CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)
- [Learn React.js: Part I](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101)
- [Learn React.js: Part II](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-102)

That should give you enough to attempt to build a website. If you want to build a mobile or desktop app, go through the same list of courses and then check out [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

There are other tools and languages you can choose if you want, but JavaScript is a good starting point because it lets you build most types of programs that people are interested in building. Good luck!
